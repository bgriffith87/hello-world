# hello-world
This will be my first repository.

I am interested in using GitHub because I develop some simple projects, and it is nice to be able to easily explore
an idea, while retaining what you know works.  This can be accomplished by frequent file saving, and renaming. But when
interdependancies between files exist, all files need to be saved and recalled, which is time consuming.

Thank you GitHub!!
